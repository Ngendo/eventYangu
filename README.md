Today social media has become the main communication channel when it comes to family,  community and even professional events. When we lose our loved ones too, we always open  Facebook, WhatsApp or Instagram accounts to collaborate with the affected people in order to give  the deceased a nice farewell. Such an event may have hundreds and sometimes even thousands of participants. These  participants need to be updated regularly. Transparency is also key since people need to raise money, purchase items e.g coffin, food, hire  tents, chairs, hearse, etc.  Current technological trends also require us to broadcast such an event via a livestream to remote  participants.
